New in Wring 1.2.0

* Found a work-around for the bug in Perl versions 5.6.0 and higher.

* Added a few rewriting rules.

* Improved testRand.pl.


New in Wring 1.1.0

* A couple of bugs fixed.  (Thanks to Heikki Tauriainen!) Code cleaned
  up a bit.

* New option -auto allows Wring to read a Buechi automaton
  specified in the format written by Buechi::ToString.

* New option -mon allows Wring to write the optimized Buechi
  automaton as a Verilog monitor.  The Verilog monitor is a module
  whose primary inputs are the atomic propositions appearing in the
  LTL formula.

* WARNING: Recent versions of Perl (including 5.6.0, 5.6.1, and 5.7.1)
  have a bug that sometimes causes the perl interpreter to crash when
  running Wring.  The Perl maintainers have been notified.  In the
  meanwhile, if you are considering upgrading from, say, 5.005, you
  may want to keep this in mind.
