The script procLTL.sh is a convenient wrapper to run ltl2aut.pl.
The header of the script has minimal instructions on how to run it.

The files in directory Test contain example formulae and automata.
The syntax supported for LTL is explained in the header of LTL.pm.
The syntax for the automata is the one used by Buechi::ToString.

Obviously, one needs dot installed to use this stuff to its full
extent.  (http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/)

testRand.pl emulates the test-bed of [Daniel99], but can also read
formulae from either a file or the command line.

testSet.pl is a test script for the Set module.

The algorithms are described in [Daniel99] and in [Somenz00].
The algorithms for the complementing extension are described in [Gurumu03].
