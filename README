 What is LTL2AIG
######################

LTL2AIG allows one to take LTL specifications and convert them into the extended
AIG format used for the synthesis competition: SYNTCOMP.

This version now allows for compositional translations. That is, we extend the
functionality of Acacia which takes LTL formulas and constructs several automata
so that the AIG generated from the formula reflects the fact that we simulate
these machines using the logic of the AIG.

Since the software LTL2AIG heavily depends on Acacia+, we include the text from
its README file as well.
